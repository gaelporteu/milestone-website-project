                            <p>WordPress, HTML & CSS using DIVI plugin</p>
                            <p>This was a project that I created for a client while I was working at RadonicRodgers Strategy+. Using a style guide and flyers that we designed I was able to assemble a website that follows the print guides quite closely using webfonts and plugins. The client "Kember Flooring" is also able to add product themselves to the website, which was a very important to them.</p>

                            <p>HTML 5 & CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</p>
                            <p>My first project done through Skillcrush. It introduced structure and organization to my HTML and CSS. Which help me understand how they affect each element on the page. Also, I was introduced to many resources that are available to me for free that I can use for inspiration and future learning. Most importantly it helped me gain much confidence in my ability to learn to code by slowly adding complexity which each stage of the project.</p>

                            <p>HTML 5 & CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</p>
                            <p>In this project, a bonus assignment given after you've completed the Jubilee website, was focused on applying more advanced CSS. Here I really got my feet wet with media queries, borders and alignment. I am able to see how by using CSS, HTML can be transformed into something remarkable and visually impactful.</p>

                            <p>HTML 5 & CSS</p>
                            <p>Another Skillcrush project. Here I am using media queries to resize the website depending on the size of the viewers screen. The process I used here was to start with the mobile version and then build each larger size (tablet and desktop versions). I really began to understand the importance of structuring the sections of the website so that controlling the visual canvas was much simpler and clearer.</p>
