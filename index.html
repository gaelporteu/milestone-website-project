                            <p>HTML 5 & CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</p>
                            <p>My first project done through Skillcrush. It introduced structure and organization to my HTML and CSS. Which help me understand how they affect each element on the page. Also, I was introduced to many resources that are available to me for free that I can use for inspiration and future learning. Most importantly it helped me gain much confidence in my ability to learn to code by slowly adding complexity which each stage of the project.</p>

                            <p>HTML 5 & CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</p>
                            <p>In this project, a bonus assignment given after you've completed the Jubilee website, was focused on applying more advanced CSS. Here I really got my feet wet with floats, borders and alignment. I am able to seen how by using CSS, HTML can be transformed into something remarkable and visually impactful.</p>

                            <p>This project was another turn at familiarizing myself with CSS. Here I really began to understand the importance of structuring the sections of the website so that controlling the visual canvas was much simpler and clearer. I also started to understand the different default attributes that each have before you even begin your coding journey.</p>

                            <p>I started taking Skillcrush classes after getting recommendations from my cat. With out her constant encouragement I would have never made it to be a purrfesional Web Developer. One day I will make the Internet a safe place for all cats, where no cat will fear being meme-ified and exploited for their cuteness.</p>
